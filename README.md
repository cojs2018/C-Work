## Final year project
Please go to this branch to view my final year project work. This is an extension of the blam software created by Erik Nelson. https://github.com/erik-nelson/blam.

## Other projects
Please go to this branch to view a edge pairing project that tries to match values of signals. Although this is considered impossible by some, I tried my best to match uo as many points of data as possible.
